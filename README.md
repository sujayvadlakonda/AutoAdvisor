  ```
  pip install pipreqs
  ```
  2. After installation, copy the path to the project folder, whose dependencies you want to generate a *requirements.txt* file for, and paste it in *Command prompt* after typing in `pipreqs` , as shown here: 
  ```
  pipreqs TypeFolderPathHere
  ```
  3. If a *requirements.txt* file is generated, you'll see a success message in Command Prompt

- To install packages using the *requirement.txt* file instead of manually doing so:

  2. Go to the directory where your *requirements.txt* file is located.
  3. If you're in the mentioned directory, run the following command by entering it in *Command Prompt* and the press enter:

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  4. If you aren't in the mentioned directory, where your *requirements.txt* file is located, then enter into *Command Prompt*:
  ```
  pip install -r TypePathTorequirements.txtFileHere
  ```

- If the previous/next page button you made isn't working, then check to see if you have the following added: 
  1. Add to the () of the *For Loop* located in *degreeApp.py*: the Class Name of the file you want displayed as a page in the application 
  2. Add to the top of the *degreeApp.py* file: 
  ```
  from insertYourFileNameHere import InsertYourClassNameHere
  ```
  3. Make sure that in the *Command* section of your Button, the Class Name, that you want the button to go to, is enclosed in ""
  ```
  button_example = ttk.Button(
              self,
              text="InsertButtonNameHere",
              command=lambda: self.controller.show_frame("InsertClassNameHere")
